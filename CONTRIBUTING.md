## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.0 or higher
- Composer
- Node.js 18+ and Yarn
- WordPress 6.0+ development environment
- Advanced Custom Fields plugin (Free or Pro)

### Issues and Feature Requests

1. **Search existing issues** before creating new ones
2. **Use issue templates** when available
3. **Provide detailed information** including:
   - WordPress version
   - PHP version
   - ACF version
   - Plugin version
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs actual behavior

## Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/acf-admin-categories.git
cd acf-admin-categories

# Add the original repository as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/code-soup/acf-admin-categories.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# Install Node.js dependencies
yarn install
```

### 3. Development Environment

Set up a local WordPress development environment with:
- WordPress 6.0+
- PHP 8.0+
- ACF plugin installed and activated

### 4. Build Assets

```bash
# Development build with watch
yarn dev

# Production build
yarn build
```

## Making Changes

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
# Update your fork
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 2. Development Guidelines

#### File Structure

- **PHP Classes**: Use PSR-4 autoloading in `includes/` directory
- **Assets**: Source files in `src/`, compiled files in `dist/`
- **Templates**: PHP templates in `templates/` directory

#### Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: PascalCase (`ACF_Setup`, `CategoryManager`)
- **Files**: kebab-case with appropriate prefixes
  - Classes: `class-acf-setup.php`
  - Interfaces: `category-interface.php`
  - Traits: `helpers-trait.php`
- **Methods**: camelCase (`getCategoryCount`)
- **Variables**: snake_case (`$category_id`)
- **Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (`PLUGIN_VERSION`)

#### WordPress Standards

- Follow [WordPress Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/)
- Use WordPress hooks and filters appropriately
- Sanitize, validate, and escape all user input
- Use proper nonces for security
- Follow WordPress database best practices

## Submitting Changes

### 1. Code Quality Checks

Before submitting, ensure your code passes all checks:

```bash
# Lint PHP files
composer lint

# Check coding standards
composer phpcs

# Fix coding standards issues
composer phpcbf

# Run all CI checks
composer ci
```

### 2. Commit Guidelines

Use conventional commit messages:

```bash
# Format: type(scope): description
git commit -m "feat(admin): add category filtering interface"

- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Release Steps

1. Update version in all relevant files
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create release branch
4. Final testing
5. Merge to main
6. Create GitHub release
7. Publish to WordPress.org (if applicable)
